This is Data Cleaning, Preprocessing project and therefore no ML has been attempted. 
In this project, we were provided with a census dataset and tasked with performing descriptive statistical analysis and selecting appropriate visualizations to aid in understanding the data. Based on our analysis, we were also asked to comment on the quality and characteristics of the data and suggest any pre-processing tasks that may be required.

Our report begins with a short introduction providing an overview of the census dataset. We then move on to a section where we describe the data using various analytical methods and visualizations. In this section, we present a summary of the data, including the number of rows and columns, the data types, and any missing values. We also provide insights into the characteristics of the data by analyzing the distribution of various attributes and exploring relationships between different variables. We use a variety of visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to aid in the understanding of the data.

Next, we provide a section describing what pre-processing may be needed and why. Based on our analysis, we identify several areas where data transformation and cleansing tasks may be required. These include handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and normalizing the data to remove any potential biases.

Finally, we conclude our report with a summary of our findings. We highlight the key insights we gained from our analysis and provide recommendations for any further data exploration or pre-processing tasks that may be necessary. Overall, our report provides a comprehensive overview of the census dataset and lays the groundwork for future analysis and modeling tasks.
